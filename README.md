Hello friends in this repository I build an web application using streamlit which is used to retrieve tweet data using certain user required search term and upload it to our MongoDB database and also can save the data in our local computer in CSV/JSON format

**First of all I created a 'function' python file and programmed the bacis function of scrapping and the option of uploading to MongoDB.**

**After creating that file I created a streamlit web application to make the code user friendly and to be accessible to even normal peoples.**


**To install Snscrape we need to use developer package to get this code running**

'Snscrape requires at least Python 3.8 or higher.'
>'pip3 install git+https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape.git'

**After installing snscrape we created function to scrape data from twitter**

**And also created a function named upload_to_mongodb to upload data to our database**

**After creating these functions we created our  web application using streamlit**


**Happy programming**

**Demo video is very short and in two parts because github is not allowing more than 25 mb file size**

**Below is the link of full demo video**
