Hello friends in this repository I build an web application using streamlit which is used to retrieve tweet data using certain user required search term and upload it to our MongoDB database and also can save the data in our local computer in CSV/JSON format

**First of all I created a 'function' python file and programmed the bacis function of scrapping and the option of uploading to MongoDB.**

**After creating that file I created a streamlit web application to make the code user friendly and to be accessible to even normal peoples.**
